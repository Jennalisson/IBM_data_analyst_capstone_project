# IBM_data_analyst_capstone_project
This repository contains the data visualization design for an interactive business intelligence dashboard analyzing global developer trends and demographics. The dashboard was built using IBM Cognos Analytics and utilizes a pre-cleaned, normalized dataset to accurately capture "Top N" insights from multi-select survey responses.
# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, 360-degree view of the current and future state of developer technology usage and demographics.

The dashboard is structured into three main tabs, allowing stakeholders to easily navigate between key insights:

Current Technology Usage: What technologies are developers actively working with today?

Future Technology Usage: What technologies are developers most eager to adopt next year (future trends)?

Demographics: Who are the respondents, where are they located, and what is their background?
